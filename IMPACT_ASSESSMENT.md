  - Replace sport-specific prompts with dynamic generation
  - Use equipment registry for workout recommendations
  - Generate prompts based on user's actual equipment
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

#### 3. **web_server.py** (Complexity: MEDIUM)
- **Current**: Routes assume specific sports
- **Changes Required**:
  - Add configuration management endpoints
  - Update workout analysis to use dynamic sports
  - Add configuration UI routes
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 days

### Medium-Impact Files (Moderate Changes)

#### 4. **strava_client.py** (Complexity: MEDIUM)

  - Add metric abstraction
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

#### 5. **templates/index.html** (Complexity: MEDIUM)
- **Changes Required**:
  - Dynamic sport/equipment dropdowns
  - Configurable zone displays
  - Remove hardcoded sport references
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

### New Components Required

#### 6. **sport_config_service.py** (NEW)
```python
# Core configuration management
- SportConfigService class
- ZoneCalculatorFactory
- MetricAbstraction classes
- Equipment registry
```
**Estimated Effort**: 3 days

#### 7. **config_generator.py** (NEW)
```python
# AI-powered configuration generation
- Preference parser
- AI prompt builder
- Schema validator
- Migration utilities
```
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days

#### 8. **templates/config_editor.html** (NEW)
- Visual configuration editor
- Zone model designer
- Equipment manager
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days

## Code Impact Analysis

### Lines of Code to Change
- **Direct modifications**: ~1,500 lines
- **New code**: ~2,000 lines
- **Total impact**: ~3,500 lines

### Breaking Changes
1. **API Changes**:
   - `/api/workouts` response structure will include sport configuration
   - New endpoints for configuration management

2. **Data Structure Changes**:
   - Activity analysis format will change
   - Zone calculation results will include metadata

3. **Configuration Changes**:
   - New `sport_config.json` file required
   - Some .env variables become deprecated

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Migration failures | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing, rollback plan |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Caching, optimization |
| AI misconfiguration | Medium | Medium | Validation, manual override |
| Zone calculation errors | Low | High | Extensive unit tests |

### User Experience Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Configuration complexity | High | Medium | Good defaults, wizards |
| Learning curve | Medium | Low | Documentation, examples |
| Feature parity loss | Low | High | Careful migration testing |

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Implementation (Week 1-2)
- Build new components alongside existing code
- No changes to current functionality
- Develop migration tools

### Phase 2: Feature Flag Rollout (Week 3-4)
- Add feature flag for new system
- Allow opt-in testing
- Gather feedback

### Phase 3: Gradual Migration (Week 5-6)
- Migrate willing users
- Fix issues discovered
- Refine configuration UI

### Phase 4: Full Cutover (Week 7-8)
- Migrate remaining users
- Remove legacy code
- Documentation update

## Resource Requirements

### Development Effort
- **Total Estimate**: 6-8 weeks for full implementation
- **Developer Resources**: 1-2 developers
- **Testing Resources**: Comprehensive test suite needed

### Infrastructure Changes
- No database required (JSON file-based)
- Minimal performance impact
- No additional services needed

## Benefits Realization Timeline

### Immediate Benefits (Weeks 1-4)
- Cleaner code architecture
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing

### Short-term Benefits (Weeks 5-8)
- Support for new sports
- Custom zone models
- Equipment flexibility

### Long-term Benefits (Months 2-6)
- Community contributions
- Plugin architecture potential
- Multi-platform support

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start Small**: Begin with configuration schema and validation
2. **Prototype First**: Build proof-of-concept for one sport
3. **Iterate**: Get user feedback early and often
4. **Document Well**: Create comprehensive migration guides

## Conclusion

While this transformation requires significant changes, the benefits far outweigh the costs. The investment will result in a more flexible, maintainable, and user-friendly system that can adapt to any athlete's needs. The phased approach minimizes risk while allowing for course corrections based on user feedback.

### Go/No-Go Recommendation: **GO**

The transformation is technically feasible, provides clear user value, and positions the tool for long-term success. The modular approach allows for incremental progress with measurable milestones.
