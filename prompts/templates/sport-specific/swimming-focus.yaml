      Technique Improvement Strategy:
      
      Common Limiters and Fixes:
      
      Freestyle Issues:
      1. Poor catch
         - Drill: Fist drill → feel water with forearm
         - Focus: High elbow catch
         - Sets: 8x25 drill, 25 swim
      
      2. Low body position
         - Drill: Kick with board at 45°
         - Focus: Press chest down, hips up
         - Core work on deck
      
      3. Crossing over
         - Drill: Single arm with board
         - Focus: Wide hand entry
         - Visualize swimming on rails
      
      4. Inefficient breathing
         - Drill: 3-5-7 breathing pattern
         - Focus: Exhale underwater
         - Practice bilateral breathing
      
      Video Analysis Protocol:
      - Above water: Side view for body position
      - Below water: Front view for catch
      - Review monthly for progress

    nutrition_hydration: |
      Swimming Nutrition Considerations:
      
      Pre-Swim (1-2 hours before):
      - Light carbs: Banana, toast, oatmeal
      - Avoid high fiber
      - Hydrate well
      - Coffee if morning swim
      
      During Swim:
      - Water bottle on deck
      - Sports drink for 90min+
      - Small snacks for long sessions
      - Maintain energy levels
      
      Post-Swim:
      - Immediate: Quick carbs + protein
      - Chocolate milk ideal
      - Full meal within 2 hours
      - Rehydrate fully
      
      Special Considerations:
      - Early morning: Lighter pre-swim fuel
      - Double sessions: Fuel between
      - Competition: Tested foods only
      - Cold water: Extra calories needed
