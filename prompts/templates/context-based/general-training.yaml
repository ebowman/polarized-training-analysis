    required:
      - fitness_level: "beginner|intermediate|advanced"
      - available_hours_per_week: "number (3-20)"
      - primary_goals: "array of goals"
    optional:
      - equipment_available: "array of equipment"

  prompt_sections:
    context_analysis: |
      Analyze the athlete's profile:
      - Current fitness level: {fitness_level}
      - Training experience: {years_training}
      - Available time: {available_hours_per_week} hours/week
      - Equipment access: {equipment_available}
      - Previous injuries or limitations: {injury_history}
      
      Consider training history and adaptation capacity for appropriate progression.
    
    goal_prioritization: |
      Structure training to achieve:
      Primary Goals (highest priority):
      {primary_goals}
      
      Secondary Goals (incorporate when possible):
      {secondary_goals}
      
      Timeline: {target_timeframe}
      
      Apply goal-specific periodization and progressive overload principles.
    
    training_philosophy: |
      Apply Polarized Training Distribution:
      - Zone 1-2 (Easy): 80% of training time
      - Zone 3 (Moderate): Minimize (5-10%)
      - Zone 4-5 (Hard): 10-15% of training time
      
      Key Principles:
      1. Consistency over intensity
      2. Progressive overload (weekly volume +5-10%)
      3. Adequate recovery between hard sessions
      4. Multi-modal approach for balanced fitness
    
    weekly_structure: |
      Design weekly schedule considering:
      - Total volume: {available_hours_per_week} hours
      - Hard sessions: 2-3 per week (separated by easy days)
      - Long endurance session: 1 per week
      - Strength training: 2-3 sessions
      - Recovery/easy days: 3-4 per week
      - Complete rest: 1-2 days per week
      
      Preferred training days: {preferred_training_days}
    
    exercise_selection: |
      Select exercises based on:
      1. Goal specificity
      2. Equipment availability: {equipment_available}
      3. Skill level and experience
      4. Injury prevention needs
      5. Personal preferences
      
      Avoid these exercises: {avoided_exercises}
      
      Prioritize compound movements and functional patterns.
    
    intensity_management: |
      Manage training intensity using:
      - Heart Rate Zones for endurance work
      - Power Zones for cycling (if power meter available)
      - RPE for strength training
      - Pace zones for running
      
      Session intensity distribution:
      - Easy (Zone 1-2): Include movement variety, focus on form
      - Moderate (Zone 3): Limited use, mainly during tempo work
      - Hard (Zone 4-5): Structured intervals with specific work:rest ratios
    
    progression_strategy: |
      Week-over-week progression:
      1. Weeks 1-3: Build volume at low intensity
      2. Week 4: Recovery week (70% volume)
      3. Weeks 5-7: Maintain volume, increase intensity
      4. Week 8: Recovery week
      5. Weeks 9-11: Peak phase - highest quality work
      6. Week 12: Taper and test
    
    recovery_integration: |
      Recovery protocols:
      - 48 hours between hard sessions targeting same muscle groups
      - Active recovery sessions at Zone 1
      - Include mobility work on easy days
      - Sleep target: 7-9 hours
      - Nutrition focus on recovery days
    
    constraint_handling: |
      Address common constraints:
      Time limitations:
      - Prioritize higher intensity when time is limited
      - Use circuit training for efficiency
      - Combine strength and cardio when needed
      
      Equipment limitations:
      - Provide bodyweight alternatives
      - Suggest minimal equipment options
      - Focus on movement quality over load
    
    safety_checks: |
      Ensure all recommendations follow safety guidelines:
      - Warm-up protocols for all sessions
      - Gradual progression (10% rule)
      - Technique focus before intensity
      - Listen to body signals
      - Include deload weeks
      - Monitor fatigue and overtraining signs
    
    recommendation_generation: |
      Generate specific workout recommendations:
      1. Provide detailed daily workouts
      2. Include warm-up and cool-down
      3. Specify sets, reps, intensity, and rest
      4. Offer scaling options
      5. Include coaching cues
      6. Provide alternative exercises
      
      Format each workout with:
      - Duration
      - Intensity target
      - Main work
      - Notes and modifications
