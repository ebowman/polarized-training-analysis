    equipment_adaptation: |
      Creative Equipment Substitutions:
      
      Barbell Movements → Dumbbell Variations:
      - Barbell squat → Goblet squat or DB front squat
      - Barbell deadlift → DB Romanian deadlift or single-leg deadlift
      - Barbell row → DB row or cable row
      - Barbell press → DB press or cable press
      
      Missing Equipment Workarounds:
      - No pull-up bar → Cable lat pulldowns or band pull-aparts
      - No heavy weights → Increase time under tension, add pauses
      - No rowing machine → Treadmill intervals + DB rows
      - Limited dumbbells → Unilateral work, drop sets, circuits
    
    workout_strategies: |
      Hotel Gym Optimization Tactics:
      
      1. Circuit Training Focus
      - Minimize equipment hogging
      - Maintain intensity with less rest
      - Combine cardio and strength
      
      2. Time-Efficient Sessions
      - 30-45 minute sessions
      - Superset opposing muscle groups
      - Use timed intervals vs rep counting
      
      3. Intensity Techniques
      - Drop sets with limited weights
      - Isometric holds
      - Tempo manipulation (3-1-3 count)
      - Mechanical advantage shifts
      
      4. Room Workout Backup Plans
      - Bodyweight HIIT circuits
      - Yoga/mobility flows
      - Resistance band routines
      - Core-focused sessions
    
    travel_specific_considerations: |
      Address Travel Challenges:
      
      Jet Lag Management:
      - Light cardio for first 1-2 days
      - Avoid high intensity until adjusted
      - Morning workouts to reset circadian rhythm
      
      Business Travel Schedule:
      - Early morning sessions (pre-meetings)
      - Quick 20-minute maintenance workouts
      - In-room bodyweight circuits as backup
      
      Vacation Mode:
      - Fun, exploratory workouts
      - Include local activities (hiking, swimming)
      - Focus on movement quality over intensity

    progression_during_travel: |
      Maintain Fitness While Traveling:
      
      Short Trip (< 1 week):
      - Maintain intensity, reduce volume
      - Focus on movement quality
      - 2-3 sessions sufficient
      
      Medium Trip (1-2 weeks):
      - Week 1: Adaptation phase (70% normal volume)
      - Week 2: Return to 85-90% volume
      - Include one challenging session per week
      
      Long Trip (> 2 weeks):
      - Establish routine by day 3
      - Progress intensity weekly
      - Find local gym for 1-2 sessions if possible
