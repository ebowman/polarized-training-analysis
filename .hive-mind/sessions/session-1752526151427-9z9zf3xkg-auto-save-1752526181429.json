            "objective": "I made this with the intention that it would be generally useful for lots of different sports, potentially, with everything custom in .env and workout_preferences_personal.md. Unfortunately I believe assumptions have crept in to the code about peloton, rowing, etc. It's not easy to break out of that, but I'd like everything to be driven by those two files. For example, maybe there is a json schema that describes the user's preferences, and we use AI to generate that from workout_preferences_personal.md for us? This is adelicate, complex, and high-value pivot to make this more generally useful. Let's start with just looking at how we might pivot to a more general purpose architecture by designing such an architecture and assessing what the change to the existing system might be",
