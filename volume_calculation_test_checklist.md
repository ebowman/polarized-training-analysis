# Volume Calculation Test Checklist

## Summary of Fixes Validated

The UI Consistency Fixer successfully resolved the volume calculation inconsistencies. All UI components now properly filter activities to only include those with zone data when calculating polarized training totals.

## Test Checklist

### ‚úÖ Core Volume Calculation Tests

1. **Zone Data Requirement** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Only activities WITH zone data (zone1_percent > 0 OR zone2_percent > 0 OR zone3_percent > 0) count toward the 360 min/week target
   - [x] Activities with 0% in all zones are excluded from polarized totals
   - [x] Debug logging added to track activities without zones

2. **UI Consistency** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Progress card (7-Day Achievement) shows correct polarized minutes
   - [x] Combined chart shows same total as progress card
   - [x] Volume tracking chart shows consistent totals
   - [x] AI recommendations use filtered activities with zones

3. **Activity Classification** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Strength training (WeightTraining, Workout) ‚Üí Ancillary work only
   - [x] Activities with zone data ‚Üí Polarized training volume
   - [x] Missing sport_type ‚Üí Defaults to 'Unknown', attempts HR analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Edge Cases

1. **Yoga Activities**
   - Current behavior: Yoga is NOT in the WeightTraining/Workout list
   - Result: Yoga WILL count toward polarized volume if it has zone data
   - To exclude: Add Yoga to sport_config.json with 'ancillary' tag

2. **Unknown Sport Types**
   - Activities with missing/unknown sport_type will attempt HR analysis
   - If zones are detected, they count toward polarized volume
   - No crashes or calculation errors

3. **Partial Zone Data**
   - Activity must have at least one zone > 0% to be included
   - Activities with some missing zones still count (e.g., only zone1 data)

### üìä Volume Calculation Formula

```
Polarized Training Volume = Sum of all activities where:
  - (zone1_percent > 0 OR zone2_percent > 0 OR zone3_percent > 0)
  - AND sport_type NOT IN ['WeightTraining', 'Workout']
  - AND sport NOT tagged as 'ancillary' in sport_config.json

Ancillary Work = Sum of all activities where:
  - sport_type IN ['WeightTraining', 'Workout']
  - OR sport tagged as 'ancillary' in sport_config.json
```

### üß™ Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Zone Filtering**
   - Upload an activity with no HR/power data
   - Verify it doesn't appear in polarized totals
   - Check console logs for "Activity without zones" message

2. **Test Yoga Handling**
   - Upload a Yoga activity with HR data
   - Verify it DOES count toward polarized volume
   - To exclude: Add to sport_config.json with ancillary tag

3. **Test Progress Consistency**
   - Check 7-day progress card minutes
   - Check combined chart total minutes
   - Verify both show the same polarized total

4. **Test Strength Training**
   - Upload a WeightTraining activity
   - Verify it shows as ancillary work
   - Verify it does NOT count toward 360 min/week

### üîç Debug Information

The UI now logs detailed information to help debug volume calculations:

```javascript
// Console logs added:
- "üìä DisplaySummary: Found X total activities, Y with zone data, Z zone minutes"
- "Activities with zones: [list]"
- "Activities without zones: [list]"
- "üìä Activity without zones: [name] ([duration]min)"
- "üìä Volume Tracking Calculation: [breakdown of minutes]"
```

### ‚úÖ Validation Status: PASSED

All volume calculation fixes have been validated and are working correctly. The UI now consistently shows only activities with zone data in the polarized training totals, properly excludes ancillary work, and maintains consistency across all components.

## Recommendations

1. **Configure Yoga**: If you want Yoga excluded from polarized volume, add it to sport_config.json with the 'ancillary' tag
2. **Monitor Console**: Use browser console to see detailed activity classification
3. **Check Unknown Activities**: Review activities with 'Unknown' sport type to ensure proper classification
