## Weekly Structure Preferences

### Ideal Week Layout
- **Monday**: Moderate intensity (Zone 2-3 focus)
- **Tuesday**: High intensity intervals (Zone 4-5)
- **Wednesday**: Recovery or strength training
- **Thursday**: Threshold work (Zone 3-4)

- **Saturday**: Long endurance session (Zone 1-2)
- **Sunday**: Recovery activity or complete rest

## Special Considerations

### Injury History

- **Left knee**: Prefer cycling over running for high volume
- **Shoulders**: Include mobility work after rowing sessions

### Motivation & Enjoyment
- **Variety**: Change workout types every 2-3 weeks
- **Challenges**: Enjoy progressive overload and measurable goals
- **Social**: Prefer solo training but occasional group rides
- **Weather**: Cold weather tolerance, prefer indoor when <30Â°F

## AI Coaching Notes

Please consider these personal factors when generating recommendations:
1. **Always suggest specific Peloton classes** when recommending cycling
2. **Include rowing alternatives** for cycling-heavy weeks
3. **Respect sleep and recovery** - if feeling tired, prioritize easy sessions
4. **Focus on consistency** over perfection - sustainable > optimal
5. **Provide 2-3 options** when possible (different durations/intensities)
