# Polarized Training Analysis

A comprehensive tool for analyzing your training data to assess adherence to the polarized training approach, based on the research paper ["Training Intensity Distribution in Endurance Athletes: Are We Asking the Right Questions?"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4621419/).

## Overview

The polarized training approach suggests that endurance athletes should spend approximately:
- **80%** of training time in Zone 1 (Low Intensity)
- **10%** of training time in Zone 2 (Threshold)  
- **10%** of training time in Zone 3 (High Intensity)

This tool downloads your training data from Strava, analyzes your heart rate and power zones, and provides detailed insights into how well you're following this proven training methodology. It also generates intelligent, research-based workout recommendations to help you maintain optimal training distribution.

## Features

### üìä **Web Dashboard**
- Interactive bar charts for each workout showing zone distribution
- Combined chart showing aggregate training distribution vs. targets
- Time range filtering (7 days to all time)
- **üì• One-Click Strava Download** with OAuth2 integration
- Intelligent workout recommendations with detailed structure and reasoning
- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Recommendations** using OpenAI o3 with session-based loading
- Real-time data refresh with smart caching
- **üìã Recommendation History** with browser-based storage
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### üìà **Training Analysis**
- Heart rate zone analysis based on maximum heart rate
- Power zone analysis based on Functional Threshold Power (FTP)
- Adherence scoring (0-100 scale)
- Research-based workout recommendations with dual-window approach

### üïê **Dual-Window Analysis Approach**
Based on sports science research, the tool uses two different time windows:

- **Display Analysis**: User-selected time range (7 days to all time)
  - Shows historical trends and long-term adherence
  - Allows exploration of different training periods
  - Used for zone distribution charts and summaries

- **Workout Recommendations**: Fixed 14-day window
  - Based on research showing 1-2 weeks as optimal for immediate training decisions
  - Captures recent training stress and recovery needs
  - Prevents recommendations from being skewed by viewing preferences
  - Aligns with elite athlete patterns (2 hard sessions per week)

### üéØ **Intelligent Workout Recommendations**
The tool generates specific, actionable workout recommendations using advanced analysis:

- **Dual Metrics Analysis**: Considers both percentage distribution AND absolute time in each zone
- **Volume Assessment**: Evaluates if total training volume meets minimum thresholds
- **Intensity Requirements**: Ensures adequate Zone 3 time for fitness maintenance (‚â•30min/week)
- **Recovery Patterns**: Analyzes recent workout intensity and recommends appropriate recovery
- **Smart Prioritization**: High-priority recommendations for critical training gaps
- **Detailed Structure**: Complete workout descriptions with warmup, intervals, and cooldown
- **Scientific Reasoning**: Evidence-based explanations for each recommendation

**Key Analysis Factors:**
- **Total Training Volume**: Minimum 3 hours/week for meaningful adaptation
- **Zone 3 Minimum**: At least 30 minutes/week of high-intensity work
- **Zone 1 Baseline**: Minimum 70% of total time for aerobic base
- **Recovery Timing**: Days since last high-intensity session
- **Pattern Recognition**: Recent workout type distribution

**Example Recommendations:**
- üö® üü¢ Volume building workout (108m): "Your weekly volume (142min) is below minimum (180min)"
- üö® üî¥ High-intensity intervals (75m): "You're only getting 15min/week of Zone 3 (need ‚â•30min)"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è üü¢ Long aerobic base ride (3h 12m): "You need 15.3% more Zone 1 training"
- üí° üü° Tempo workout (45m): "Optional technique work to maintain neuromuscular fitness"

### üîÑ **Data Integration**
- **One-Click Download**: OAuth2 integration for seamless Strava authorization
- **Smart Caching**: Only downloads new activities, preserves existing cache
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking downloads with progress indicators
- Downloads activity details and streams (heart rate, power, time)
- Respects API rate limits with intelligent caching

```bash
# Fetch 20 most recent activities
python strava_fetch.py --count 20

# Force refresh (ignore cache)
python strava_fetch.py --count 10
```

## Training Zone Systems

This tool uses multiple zone systems to provide the most accurate training guidance:

### üìä **Polarized Training Zones (for overall analysis)**
Research-based 3-zone system for training distribution:
- **Polarized Zone 1**: Low Intensity - **80%** target (aerobic base)
- **Polarized Zone 2**: Threshold - **10%** target (lactate threshold)  
- **Polarized Zone 3**: High Intensity - **10%** target (VO2 max)

### üö¥ **Power Zones (for Peloton cycling)**
Activity-specific zones based on your FTP (301W):
- **Power Zone 1-3**: 0-90% FTP ‚Üí Maps to Polarized Zone 1
- **Power Zone 4**: 90-105% FTP ‚Üí Maps to Polarized Zone 2
- **Power Zone 5-6**: 105%+ FTP ‚Üí Maps to Polarized Zone 3

### üö£ **Heart Rate Zones (for rowing/other activities)**
Activity-specific zones based on max HR (171 bpm):
- **HR Zone 1-2**: 86-140 bpm ‚Üí Maps to Polarized Zone 1
- **HR Zone 3-4**: 140-159 bpm ‚Üí Maps to Polarized Zone 2
- **HR Zone 5**: 159+ bpm ‚Üí Maps to Polarized Zone 3

### üèãÔ∏è **Strength Training**
Uses RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) 1-10 scale instead of zones.

**üìñ See `zone_mapping_guide.md` for detailed explanations and examples.**

**No activities found**
- Check your Strava authorization: `python strava_fetch.py --authorize`
- Ensure activities have heart rate or power data
- Try increasing the time range: `--days 90`

**API rate limit exceeded**
- The tool uses aggressive caching to respect Strava's rate limits
- Wait 15 minutes or use cached data
- Check `cache/` directory for existing data

**Import errors**
- Ensure virtual environment is activated: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Web server issues**
- Check if port 5000 is available
- Run analysis first: `python polarized_training_analysis.py`
- Try different port: `python web_server.py --port 8080`

## Research Background

This tool is based on the research paper:

**"Training Intensity Distribution in Endurance Athletes: Are We Asking the Right Questions?"**
*Laursen, P. B., & Buchheit, M. (2019). Sports Medicine, 49(2), 153-173.*

The polarized training model suggests that the most effective training distribution for endurance athletes is:
- High volume at low intensity (Zone 1)
- Minimal time at moderate intensity (Zone 2)
- Strategic high-intensity work (Zone 3)

This approach has been validated across multiple sports and athlete populations.

### Time Window Research

The dual-window approach is based on the following research findings:

- **Minimum Assessment Period**: Research shows polarized distribution should be assessed over "at least a week, if not longer"
- **Optimal Analysis Window**: 4-12 weeks provides meaningful training distribution analysis
- **Immediate Recommendations**: 1-2 weeks captures recent training stress and recovery needs
- **Elite Patterns**: Elite athletes typically perform 2 high-intensity sessions per week, creating 14-day training patterns
- **Physiological Windows**: Training adaptations and recovery occur over 7-14 day periods
